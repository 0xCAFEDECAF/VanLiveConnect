1.2.0
    User interface improvements:
    * Add automotive icons from Material Design font (https://github.com/Templarian/MaterialDesign)
    * Climate control popup shows readout of condenser pressure sensor in bar, not in degrees Celsius/Fahrenheit
    * Sat nav: better emulation of the behaviour of the original MFD, by keeping list grayed out until the
      actual content has been received from the sat nav unit
    * Improve handling of IR remote control 'VAL' button on popups: match behaviour of original MFD
    * Show popup 'Computing route in progress' also while driving, similar to original MFD
    * Fix bug in trip computer cycling sequence when starting from "GPS info" screen
    * In sat nav guidance mode, always show instruments in small screen. Trip computer is shown in popup,
      like in the original MFD.
    * When user is browsing the menu, only show popups for warnings, not for info
    * Fix: screen occasionally switches back to 'clock' directly after switching to 'pre-flight'
    * Fix bug where current station is not highlighted in tuner presets popup
    * Tapping the screen when a popup is visible will exit the popup

    "Under the hood" improvements:
    * Improved Wi-Fi connectivity by working around an apparent bug in class AsyncWebSocketClient
      (ESPAsyncWebSrv library and its interworking with EPSAsyncTCP library)
    * Improved Wi-Fi connectivity by checking more often if there are queued JSON packets to be sent
    * Web server handles low-memory conditions by responding with HTTP code 429 ("too many requests - try again later")
    * Fixed captive portal handling
    * Fixed infinite-loop bug, causing occasional software watchdog timeout

    Minor changes:
    * Wi-Fi access point (AP) IP address is changed to 192.168.4.1, and now is by default configured to have a password
    * README.md: better explanation how to connect Android to both Wi-Fi and Mobile Data simultaneously

1.1.0
    User interface improvements:
    * Use the [Peugeot-New](https://www.cdnfonts.com/peugeot-new.font) font in the Web-based user interface
    * Three color themes (blue, orange and gold) selectable in "Set color and brightness" menu screen
    * Many small improvements in user interface layout and handling ("Doors locked" popup, sat nav "no audio" icon, ...)
    * Better handling of sat nav initialization, CD change and download
    * Improved handling or IR remote control
    * Serve up to two connected clients
    * Show lights and indicator status also on small (left) "Instruments" panel

    "Under the hood" improvements:
    * Web server can now also use the new "LittleFS" Flash File system (as alternative to the SPIFFS) to serve its
      web documents from
    * Minimize loss of important data in flaky Wi-Fi environments by classifying data. Important data is kept for
      later (re-)transmission if the WebSocket transmission queue is running full
    * Selective response to Android  'http://.../generate_204' requests, enabling the use of mobile data for internet
      connectivity, while still receiving vehicle data via Wi-Fi.
    * Tested up to ESP8266 board package version 3.1.2
    * Added patches and patched copies for some of the files of the used libraries
    * WebSocket: switched from "WebSockets" library (https://github.com/Links2004/arduinoWebSockets) to
      "ESPAsyncWebSrv" library (https://github.com/dvarrel/ESPAsyncWebSrv)
    * WebServer: switched from "ESP8266WebServer " library (as shipped with ESP8266 board package) to
      "ESPAsyncWebSrv" library (https://github.com/dvarrel/ESPAsyncWebSrv)
    * Fix compiler warnings
    * Improve debug output (on serial console)
